Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto

Typeset in Lilypond

NOTE: Clarinets, horns, and trumpets are entered as written and converted to CP with \transposition.

The "default" midi file and piano parts contain the "toccata" cadenza; files tagged with "ossia" are also
created containing the ossia cadenza (in the score this is set as an ossia as is standard).

A "Midi instrument rollover" warning is generated when building the midi files in spite of there
being only 15 instruments + percussion. I suspect that this is a bug in lily; it does not seem to
affect the output as long as the percussion is the last staff in the driver file.
